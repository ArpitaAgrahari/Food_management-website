## Problem Statement

- A huge increase can be seen in food waste. According to data provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/flw-data), globally 1/3 of the food produced for human consumption is wasted, which accounts for about 1.3 billion tones per year. On the other hand, according to WHO 20% of the population face extreme food shortage. Hence there is a need to come up with a solution that can avoid wastage of food and help feed the needy.
- This Web-based Food Waste Management system can assist in collecting the leftover food from hotels & restaurants to distribute among those in need. NGOs that are helping poor communities to battle against starvation & malnutrition can raise a request for food supply from restaurants through this application. Once the request is accepted, the NGOs can collect the food from the restaurants for its distribution. In this way, this web-based food waste management system will help restaurants to reduce food waste and will help in feeding the poor and needy people.


## Motivation

- As we know, our world is battling high food wastage, widespread hunger and extensive food insecurity. These are all problems that directly affect the basic quality of life. Moreover, higher food wastage also means that we would need to build more waste disposal facilities, which leads to an unnecessary increase energy consumption. 

  However, by distributing these food leftovers to people who are unable to afford food on their own, we can alleviate their standard of living. So the value of this product is the possibility of solving all the mentioned problems, without even increasing the food output.
